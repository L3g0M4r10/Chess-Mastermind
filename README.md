# Chess Mastermind
Chess Mastermind is a project that is designed to help chess players get better at the game. Chess Mastermind does this by you inputting a chess game and it will tell you what you did right and what you did wrong. It can tell you what you should've done instead and how you can improve. It is a similar program to chess.com's game review however this program is entirely free and open-source, it can use any engine you want, and will eventually (although not yet) be able to give you in depth help with chess stratgies and tactics.

# Installation
No installer file is provided yet, instead a portable binary is provided which can be manually extracted and installed anywhere

# Compilation
The benifits of compilation is support for other platforms than windows alone. No build system is provided (coming soon) so you have to compile manually. Python3.10 libraries are required (other version have not been tested). The python libraries must be linked but other than that, use your favorite c/c++ compiler and go ahead. Please note that platforms other than windows, pythons other than 3.10, and compilers other than g++ have not been tested.
